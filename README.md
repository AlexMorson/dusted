# Dusted

An offline editor for Dustforce replays, largely based on dustkid.com's replay composer.

## Installation

`pip install dusted`

Copy `plugin/tas.as` to `~dustforce/user/script_src`, compile as an in-game plugin, and enable it.

On linux, `sudo apt-get install expect` (or equivalent, for the program `unbuffer`).

## Usage

Run the editor with

`python -m dusted`

or, if the python scripts directory is on the PATH

`dusted`
